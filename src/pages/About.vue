      <h1>About the project</h1>
      <h3>Why?</h3>
      <p>
        This is my side project like many others. Like many others - also this
        one - got me borred after few coding sessions. I thought it might not be
        only me who work on something that seems to be valuable and hide it from
        the World (another time). It's not a rocket-sience but still i find it
        as waste of time, waste of pottential and waste of knowladge. Maybe
        somebody would benefit out of this project and even build amazing
        product base on this..? I decided not only to publish it on github but
        also turn it into educational project - split it into lessons (blog
        posts) as a tutorial, and even release it as working demo available
        online. I hope beginner developers will benefit from this :)

      <h3>What?</h3>
      <p>
        Interview Frontend is a board with interview questions for frontend
        developers who want to prepare themselves to job interview (both as
        interviewee and interviewer). This is the basic concept that can be
        extended with many features that (i hope) we will recognize and plan
        together during development process.
      </p>
      <h3>How?</h3>
      <p>
        My goal is to deliver production ready app, shippable after each
        iteration. I'm planning to use Vue and Firebase and build it step by
        step. But most importantly i want to have and give you some fun out of
        it!
